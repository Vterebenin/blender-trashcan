# Experimental Blender Savings Repository aka Blender Trashcan

Enter the abyss of my Blender experimentation. Brace yourself, for here lies the raw essence of creation, untamed and unfiltered.

## Contents

Prepare yourself for a wild ride through:

- **Experiments:** Mind-bending Blender projects pushing the boundaries of creativity and technique. JK THOSE ARE TRASH haha
- **Assets:** Raw, unfiltered Blender assets - models, textures, and materials straight from the depths of my imagination. You may call this garbage! I dont care, behw.
- **Scripts:** Maybe there is gonna be some integrations with programming in a distant future. Not for now. I DONT KNOW
